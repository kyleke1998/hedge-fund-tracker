# AGENTS.md

Single source of truth for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Copilot Coding Agent, etc.). `CLAUDE.md` is a one-line `@AGENTS.md` pointer so Claude Code picks it up automatically.

## What this project is

Tracks **hedge fund SEC filings** (13F quarterly, 13D/G ownership changes, Form 4 insider trades) and runs AI-powered analysis to identify promising stocks.

```
SEC EDGAR → app/scraper/ → app/analysis/ → app/ai/ (Promise Scores) → web UI / CLI
                          ↓
                  database/ (CSV files)
```

**The angle that makes this tool different**: 13F-only trackers show data 45+ days stale. We merge 13D/G (≤10 days) and Form 4 (≤2 business days) on top of quarterly snapshots, so the consensus view reflects recent institutional activity.

## Running Python tooling (must read)

**Always run Python tooling through the pipenv venv** — `pipenv run <cmd>` (or `python -m pipenv run <cmd>` if `pipenv` is not on PATH, common on Windows; if a venv is already active in the shell its python lacks pipenv — use `py -3.13 -m pipenv run <cmd>`). The system Python lacks `pandas-stubs` and `fastapi_users` — running tests/pyright outside the venv produces import errors and ~150 false type errors. Sanity-check at session start: `python -m pipenv --venv`.

A `PreToolUse` hook in `.claude/settings.json` (script: `.claude/scripts/enforce_pipenv.py`) blocks bare invocations of `pyright`/`ruff`/`mypy`/`pytest` and `python -m <those>` when not preceded by `pipenv run`.

## Common tasks

```bash
# First-time setup
# Requires Python 3.13 (see Pipfile)
pipenv install
cp .env.example .env                        # all keys optional; app degrades gracefully
cd app/frontend && npm install && cd ../..

# Run the app
pipenv run app                              # web UI on auto-discovered port from 8000
pipenv run app-cli                          # legacy terminal menu (6 analysis options)
pipenv run update                           # database management CLI
pipenv run regenerate [fund ...]            # rebuild all quarterly comparisons from EDGAR (amendment-aware); optional fund-name filter
pipenv run gen-strategy                     # rebuild database/performance.csv (7-strategy backtest vs S&P 500)
pipenv run gen-regime                       # rebuild database/regime.csv (split-adjusted regime signals per quarter)

# Tests
pipenv run test                                                          # all (Python); alias for unittest discover
pipenv run cov                                                           # Python tests + coverage report (informational)
pipenv run python -m unittest tests.stocks.test_price_fetcher            # single file
pipenv run test-frontend                                                 # frontend (vitest); or: cd app/frontend && npm test

# Lint & format
pipenv run lint            # ruff check (Python)
pipenv run format          # ruff format
pipenv run pyright         # primary type-checker (config: pyrightconfig.json)
pipenv run typecheck       # mypy (informational, secondary)
cd app/frontend && npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm run format:check
pre-commit run --all-files # everything at once

# Docker
docker compose up --build                   # foreground
pipenv run docker-up                        # auto-port discovery wrapper
```

## Logging conventions

All status/error reporting goes through `app.utils.logger.get_logger(__name__)`. The shared `_PrefixFormatter` auto-prepends a per-level emoji marker; **don't repeat the marker inside the message body** — it doubles up.

Available levels and their auto-prefix:

| Method | Level | Auto-prefix | Typical use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `logger.debug` | 10 | `🚧 ` | dev diagnostics (filtered by default) |
| `logger.info` | 20 | `ℹ️  ` | normal events |
| `logger.progress` | 22 | `⏳ ` | "Sending request", "Trying fallback X" |
| `logger.money` | 23 | `💲 ` | price / value reporting |
| `logger.success` | 25 | `✅ ` | completed operation |
| `logger.warning` | 30 | `🚨 WARNING: ` | recoverable anomaly |
| `logger.deprecated` | 35 | `⚠️  DEPRECATED: ` | obsolete API in use |
| `logger.error` | 40 | `❌ ERROR - ` | failure (always pair with `exc_info=True` inside `except`) |
| `logger.critical` | 50 | `❌ CRITICAL - ` | severe failure |

The `emoji="..."` kwarg works on every method and **overrides the default prefix** — use it for occasional one-off markers (`logger.info("Rebuilding", emoji="🔄")`).

**Don't use `print()` outside `app/main.py` and `app/utils/console.py`.** Those two are CLI/UI rendering and are intentionally exempt; everything else goes through the logger so the SSE pipeline in `app/api/sse.py` (`_ContextAwareStdout`) can route each log line to the right per-request queue. The logger's stdout handler resolves `sys.stdout` lazily on every emit, which is what keeps SSE working — don't rebind the handler's stream.

## Footguns

These are real incidents — read before changing code in these areas.

- **Stale frontend dist served silently.** The dev server auto-rebuilds when `frontend/src/` mtimes are newer than `dist/index.html`. If you bypass `pipenv run app` and serve dist directly, edits to `.tsx` or `src/data/*.json` are invisible. Trust the auto-rebuild or run `pipenv run build-frontend` explicitly.

- **`npm run build:gh-pages` leaves `dist/` unusable for the local server, and the auto-rebuild won't fix it.** The gh-pages build emits asset paths under `/hedge-fund-tracker/`; the local server has no such prefix, so the SPA fallback returns `index.html` for every asset and the browser reports `Failed to load module script … MIME type ('text/html')` on a blank page. The staleness check compares `src/` mtimes against `dist/index.html` — the fresh gh-pages dist is *newer*, so `pipenv run app` skips the rebuild and serves it anyway. After any gh-pages build, run `npm run build` before serving locally.

- **`oxlint`'s `ignorePatterns` are relative to the CWD, not to `.oxlintrc.json`'s location.** Running `npx oxlint` from the repo root (even with `--config app/frontend/.oxlintrc.json`) does NOT ignore `src/components/ui/**` or `scripts/**` — false positives appear in vendored shadcn/ui files and build scripts that are meant to be excluded. Always run oxlint from `app/frontend` (`npm run lint`, or CI's `working-directory: app/frontend`), never from the repo root.

- **SSE stdout capture is per-request.** `app/api/sse.py` installs a `_ContextAwareStdout` wrapper at module import (so it must stay on the boot path — `app/server.py` imports it) that consults a `ContextVar` on every `write()`. Concurrent SSE streams are isolated via `contextvars` — no global lock. Don't reintroduce `sys.stdout = ...` redirections, and don't bind a logger handler to a fixed stream (the project logger resolves `sys.stdout` lazily on every emit — see "Logging conventions"). Both patterns break isolation.

- **A NASDAQ name mismatch does NOT mean a ticker change is bogus.** A genuine rebrand or reverse merger changes the company name, so it is indistinguishable from a ticker collision by name alone — gating on the name guard silently dropped legitimate renames. `_verify_change` in `app/stocks/ticker_changes.py` resolves it with two further signals: the change's `effective` date (NASDAQ's feed carries years of history, and freed symbols get reassigned, so a change older than `_MAX_CHANGE_AGE_DAYS` describes the ticker's *previous* occupant, not what we track), and whether the destination symbol is already tracked under a different CUSIP (a real collision). Don't collapse these back into the name check.

- **Wrong `Denomination` breaks non-quarterly merging.** 13D/G and Form 4 filings match by *legal name string*, not CIK. The `Denomination` column in `hedge_funds.csv` must be exact. Mismatch = silent gap in non-quarterly view.

- **`os.path.basename()` in `_safe_db_join` is intentional.** It's the CodeQL-recognised sanitizer for `py/path-injection`. The `# noqa: PTH119` is load-bearing — don't "modernize" it to `Path(s).name`.

- **`log_safe()` in `app/utils/logger.py` sanitizes log interpolations.** Fund names, tickers, CUSIPs and other user-controlled values are wrapped in `log_safe(...)` before being passed to `logger.X("msg %s", value)`. The helper strips non-printable characters (newlines, ANSI escapes, NUL) and truncates to 64 chars, preventing log forgery (a CSV row injecting `\nFAKE LOG LINE` would otherwise appear as a separate log entry in the SSE stream and CI logs). Apply the same wrapping when adding new logs that interpolate external strings; prefer lazy `%`-formatting (`"... %s ...", log_safe(x)`) over f-strings so the sanitized value is the one ultimately serialized.

- **Per-fund quarter CSVs are faithful filing records.** Totals must match EDGAR's declared `tableValueTotal`, debt/PRN positions included — a parse-time "equity-only" filter once collapsed a credit fund's AUM from ~$200M to ~$21M. Equity-only views belong to the analysis layer, never to the parser or the saved CSVs.

- **`generate_comparison` links CUSIP changes.** An unambiguous NEW/CLOSE pair resolving to the same ticker collapses into one continuing position (equity-style CUSIPs only — numeric issue code in chars 7-8; debt is never linked to the issuer's equity). Missing CLOSE rows for renamed tickers are intentional.

- **EDGAR ordering is by publication date, except same-day batches.** Filings filed the same day can list in ascending period order, and funds publish old periods late. Never assume list position == recency of period; 13F-HR/A amendments win because comparisons match by reference date, latest-published first.

- **Stock-level analysis is duplicated in Python and TS, pinned by a golden fixture.** `app/analysis/stocks.py` (`_calculate_fund_level_flags`→`_aggregate_stock_data`→`_calculate_derived_metrics`) and `dataService.ts::aggregateStockLevel` must produce identical output — the TS copy is required because GH Pages has no backend. Both assert against `tests/fixtures/analysis_golden.json`. After an intentional change to either, regenerate with `pipenv run python scripts/gen_analysis_golden.py` and update both sides, or the equivalence tests fail.

- **Share counts in the quarter CSVs are NOT split-adjusted.** They are stored exactly as filed, so a split reads as an enormous purchase: Amazon's 20:1 shows up as `+1892.3%` across 35 funds, a phantom $4.2B "buy". Worse, a split landing near quarter-end (Shopify's 10:1 fell on 29 June 2022) leaves funds filing on *different bases inside the same quarter* — three distinct implied prices for SHOP in 2022Q2 — so one per-name factor cannot fix it. Any share-based analysis must detect splits from paired per-fund ratios and confirm them against the implied price (a split divides the price; accumulation does not), then harmonise stragglers onto the consensus basis. `app/analysis/regime.py` does both; don't hand-roll a share delta without them.

- **The cost-basis band is a model output, and its inputs are on two different share bases.** Filed share counts are as-filed, prices are split-adjusted, so the two only line up after `normalise_share_basis` restates each quarter's shares — measured from the filed value-per-share against the quarter-end market close, not from a splits table. Upstream of that, `app/stocks/bar_history.py::_split_adjust` cannot assume the price source is adjusted either (the OHLCV cache is adjusted for some symbols and as-traded for others), so it settles each split from the series itself: a close that jumps by roughly the split factor across the ex-date means the earlier bars are still as-traded. Don't replace either check with a trusted splits table. And don't read the band as a fact: 13F hides intra-quarter round trips, positions open in the first tracked quarter have unknown vintage (the `seededPct` field says how much of the position that is), and it covers tracked funds only.

- **`stocks.csv` is auto-sorted on exit.** A diff that only shows reordering = something else changed. Don't commit "sort cleanup" PRs without inspecting actual content changes.

- **The backtest is a descriptive track record, not a forecast — and its params aren't tuned on return.** `app/backtest/` reads only consolidated (matured) windows; the current sample is tiny and single-regime (no down-quarter yet), so every strategy beating the S&P 500 is largely beta, not skill — even "Decreasing" beat the market because the whole institutional universe rose. `min_holders` is `round(funds/10)` per quarter on a *breadth* principle (~10% of funds), and the five non-Avg-Portfolio screens are top-30 — NOT tuned to maximise the backtest number. The price cache lives in gitignored `__pricecache__/` and makes a fund-list-change regeneration near-instant; don't commit it and don't expect it in CI (CI rebuilds cold). Historical prices are *not* immutable — Yahoo's OHLC is split-adjusted at source, so a split rescales every earlier bar; each cached row records its `fetched_at` and the first lookup of a ticker with cached rows drops the ones a later split invalidated (`_drop_split_stale`). Don't "simplify" that back to a plain key→price map.

- **`scripts/regenerate_samples.py` imports after `sys.path.insert`.** The `# noqa: E402` lines are required — moving imports above the path setup breaks resolution of `app.*` modules.

- **No price-derived or daily-churning values in committed CSVs.** They turn every regeneration into a full-file git diff. The hosted site will fetch live prices at runtime; snapshots that must accumulate belong in the future history store, not in git.

- **The smart score is institutional-only and computed on the fly, by product decision.** No sell-side analyst inputs (a full Yahoo analyst-ratings integration was built and then removed on 2026-07-12 — differentiation beats me-too data) and no precomputed CSV: the Python `score_core` and its TypeScript mirror (`lib/smartScore.ts`, pinned by hand-computed parity tests) derive it from the quarter-analysis frame, so every tab/page/backtest shows the same formula on the same universe. Don't tune score weights on backtest returns — same principle as the strategy screens — and keep the two implementations in lockstep when changing the formula.

- **Yahoo rate-limits bulk yfinance sweeps.** A concurrent fetch over thousands of tickers got the IP temporarily banned (`YFRateLimitError`) and silently degraded to empty responses. If a mass yfinance fetch ever returns, pace requests, keep workers ≤2 and back off on rate limits rather than recording gaps.

- **CRLF on Windows.** Git auto-converts. Don't fight it. Pre-commit hooks and `.editorconfig` enforce LF in repo; checkout converts as needed.

- **GH Pages mode is a separate build.** `IS_GH_PAGES_MODE=true` (set via `--mode gh-pages`) hides routes and disables AI features (no backend). Test both modes when touching routing or feature flags.

## Architecture

### Web UI

React 19 + TypeScript + Vite, served by FastAPI (`app/server.py`). `pipenv run app` starts the server on the first free port from 8000, builds dist if stale, opens browser. `--cli` falls back to terminal menu.

**Frontend stack**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, shadcn/ui (subset), Recharts, TanStack Query, react-router.

**SSE pattern** (`_make_sse_stream`): runs the target in a background thread, captures stdout via a context-local queue (see `_ContextAwareStdout` + `_request_log_q`), streams each line as `data: {"type": "log", ...}`, sends final `{"type": "result", ...}` then closes. Concurrent streams isolated via `contextvars` — no shared lock.

**Server port**: locally auto-discovers from 8000. In Docker (`DOCKER_ENV=1`) binds `0.0.0.0` on `PORT` env var. `/health` for container probes.

**AI provider routing**: every AI request includes `model_id` + `provider_id`. Backend uses `provider_id` to pick the exact client class. `database/models.csv` is the single source of truth — no hardcoded model lists in TS or Python.

### Shell, routing & branding

- **Layout** (`DashboardLayout.tsx` + `AppSidebar.tsx`): a full-height left sidebar (brand/logo at top, then nav, then footer) beside a content column with its own top-navbar (global search + theme toggle). The **logo is the sidebar toggle** (no hamburger): clicking it collapses the rail to an icon-only strip and back; state persists across reloads via SidebarProvider's `sidebar:state` cookie (read by `readSidebarOpen()`). On phones the sidebar becomes a `<Sheet>` drawer (`MobileSidebar`) and the logo opens it.
- **Routes are centralised** in `src/lib/routes.ts` — `ROUTES` constants + builders (`stockPath`, `fundPath`, `stocksByIndustry`, `aiDiligenceFor`). **Never hardcode path strings**; a slug change happens in one place. Home `/` is the marketing **`Landing`** page (rendered inside the shell, so the sidebar persists); Latest Filings lives at **`/latest`**.
- **Logo assets** live in `public/`: a single transparent `logo.png` (cyborg-bull mark) used in the header/sidebar/landing for both themes — the transparent background reads on light and dark, so there is no theme swap. Plus `favicon-16/32.png` (transparent) and `apple-touch-icon.png` (on a dark navy tile, since iOS has no alpha). Raster assets are regenerated with ImageMagick (`magick`); there is no SVG source.
- **Mobile tables → cards**: wide data tables are unusable on phones, so below `md` each becomes a stacked card list. The pattern is a `hidden md:block` table next to a `md:hidden` card list (Dashboard, StockBrowser, FundPortfolio, QuarterlyTrends, StockAnalysis, AIRanking, FundsConfig).
- **Shared search**: in-page search boxes filter through `matchesQuery()` (`src/lib/utils.ts`) — case-insensitive, null-safe, empty-query-matches-all. The "Consider Starred only" filter row is the shared `StarredFilterToggle` component. (The top-bar `GlobalSearch` is separate — it does ranked scoring, not a boolean filter.)

### GitHub Pages

Static build via `npm run build:gh-pages`:
- **Hidden pages** in GH Pages (route unreachable + sidebar entry removed): `/funds-config`, `/ai-settings`, `/database`
- **Disabled pages**: `/ai-ranking`, `/ai-diligence` show `FeatureNotAvailable`
- CSV bundled into `dist/database/` via `scripts/copy-database.mjs`
- **Static FAQ pre-render**: the `faqStaticSeo` Vite plugin (`vite.config.ts`, gh-pages only) bakes `dist/learn/index.html` with the full Q&A + JSON-LD in the HTML (so JS-less AI/search crawlers read it; the SPA still hydrates over it) and emits `dist/sitemap.xml` + `dist/robots.txt`. Caveat: under the GH Pages *project* path, `robots.txt` isn't host-root so it's not authoritative until the custom domain is live.
- SPA routing: `public/404.html` redirects to `index.html` with path encoded as query
- Config: `app/frontend/src/lib/config.ts` (`IS_GH_PAGES_MODE`, `BASE_PATH`, `DATABASE_URL`, `API_BASE`)

### Docker

Multi-stage Dockerfile (Node frontend build → Python runtime). Volumes: `database/`, `__llmcache__/`, `__reports__/`, `.env`. `entrypoint.sh` seeds DB from `database-seed/` on first run. `scripts/docker_up.py` probes a free host port (loopback bind, never `0.0.0.0`) before `docker compose up`.

### Modules at a glance

- **`app/scraper/`** — SEC EDGAR retrieval. `sec_scraper.py` fetches 13F-HR, 13D/G, Form 4 with tenacity retries + custom User-Agent. `xml_processor.py` parses 13F XML into DataFrames.
- **`app/analysis/`** — `quarterly_report.py` (delta shares/values, NEW/CLOSE positions), `stocks.py` (multi-fund consensus), `non_quarterly.py` (13D/G + Form 4 integration), `performance_evaluator.py` (HBR), `smart_scores.py` (the smart-score core: composite 1-10 from **institutional signals only** — breadth/momentum percentiles + conviction with a capped +10/high-conviction-entry bonus; deliberately NO sell-side analyst inputs, that's the product stance. Pure compute, NO persistence: the backtest derives it per point-in-time frame and the UI mirrors it in TS (`lib/smartScore.ts`) on the fly, like every other consensus metric).
- **`app/stocks/`** — CUSIP→Ticker via fallback chain: yfinance → OpenFIGI → TradingView. Reverse ticker→CUSIP (Form 4 path) via FMP (requires `FMP_API_KEY`). Industry classification via `app/stocks/classification.py::resolve_industry`: yfinance → same-Company match in stocks.csv → Groq LLM (free, picks from `sector_hierarchy.csv` vocabulary). Maintains `stocks.csv`. `PriceFetcher` uses a separate chain: yfinance → TradingView → Nasdaq (Nasdaq covers mutual funds others miss). `bar_history.py` is the *dense* price path instead: every daily bar plus volume, from a local OHLCV parquet cache (`BARS_CACHE_DIR`) or yfinance, split-adjusted onto today's basis before it leaves.
- **`app/ai/`** — Multi-provider LLM. `agent.py` runs **two-phase analysis**: (1) AI picks metric weights for current market, (2) AI computes scores using those weights. Retries up to 7× on invalid response. Clients in `clients/`: GitHub Models, Google Gemini, Groq, HuggingFace, OpenRouter.
- **`app/analysis/regime.py`** — regime signals for the `/regime` page. Change metrics (new:closed, capital recycling, untouched share, turnover) run on the funds common to consecutive quarters so a growing tracked universe never reads as trading; the mega-cap share index is chain-linked for the same reason. `detect_splits` / `harmonise_basis` neutralise splits (see Footguns), and `drop_anomalous_funds` discards fund-quarters filed in the wrong denomination by testing a fund's pricing of securities other funds also hold. Compute is offline → `scripts/gen_regime_signals.py` writes the CSV; the page only reads it.
- **`app/backtest/`** — Strategy backtester. `strategies.py` defines the seven `/quarterly` screens as `StrategySpec`s (Smart Score first, then Avg Portfolio, Consensus Buys, New Consensus, Big Bets, Increasing, Decreasing) — each mirrors its tab's default sort + filters; all but Avg Portfolio take **top 30**. Smart Score ranks by the score core the engine derives lazily on each point-in-time frame (`app/analysis/smart_scores.py::score_core`). `engine.py` reconstructs each screen point-in-time per quarter (reusing `app/analysis/stocks.py` aggregation — NOT the non-quarterly-merged view), weights every screen by `Avg_Portfolio_Pct` normalized to 100% (so strategies differ in *what* they hold, not *how* it's weighted), holds filing-date→next-filing, and computes returns vs the **S&P 500** (`BENCHMARKS`, extensible to more indices; `run_backtest`, long-format rows); `min_holders_for_quarter` = round(funds/10) per quarter. `price_cache.py` persists `(ticker, date)→price` (gitignored `__pricecache__/`) so regeneration after a fund-list change is near-instant. `report.py` writes `database/performance.csv`. Run via `pipenv run gen-strategy` or updater option 11. Compute is offline → the CSV is bundled for GH Pages; the `/performance` page only reads it (no PriceFetcher in TS).
- **`app/analysis/cost_basis.py`** — the estimated institutional cost-basis band on the stock chart. 13F says what was held, never what was paid, so the basis is simulated, not computed: each quarter's net buy is executed against that quarter's daily bars under a volume-weighted Dirichlet schedule whose concentration comes from how many days the order needs at a 10% participation cap — with the day weights exponentially tilted toward higher-priced days (`TIMING_TILT`, the systematic buy-above-VWAP bias) — correlated across funds (`CO_MOVEMENT`), then carried forward at average cost and aggregated share-weighted. Pre-history positions (unknown vintage) are priced under a diffuse prior — one unknown day of the seed lookback window per path — never sized by the participation cap, so large legacy holdings keep a wide band instead of collapsing onto a multi-year VWAP. The band is the 10th–90th percentile of the simulated aggregate. Read the module docstring before touching the model — every constant there is a modelling assumption, not a tunable.
- **`app/api/`** — FastAPI routers, each `include_router`'d by `app/server.py`: `ai.py` (Promise Score / due-diligence, blocking + SSE), `admin.py` (filing fetches, ticker/CUSIP corrections, NASDAQ ticker-change apply, quarter-gap report), plus `data.py` (database files, quarter analysis, price history, the cost-basis band) and `me.py`/`api_keys.py`/`starred.py`. Shared infra lives in `common.py` (rate limiter, request validation, JSON-safe serialization) and `sse.py` (the per-request stdout-capture wrapper — imported on the boot path so it installs once). `server.py` keeps only app setup, static-file/SPA serving, and the quarter-listing routes.
- **`app/database/`** — CSV data-access layer, a package split into `quarters.py` (quarter discovery + 13F loaders), `stocks.py` (stocks.csv CRUD, the stocks lock, ticker cascades), `funds.py` (hedge-fund add/delete/restore). The package `__init__` owns the shared constants (`DB_FOLDER`, `*_FILE`) + path-safety helpers and re-exports everything, so `from app.database import X` is unchanged. Submodules read `DB_FOLDER` as `_db.DB_FOLDER` (call-time) so tests can monkeypatch it.

### Key frontend files

- `src/lib/dataService.ts` — all CSV reads via HTTP; single source for analysis logic
- `src/lib/smartScore.ts` — TS mirror of the Python smart-score core (`smartScoreComponents`/`withSmartScores`, applied by the quarter loaders) + the score tone/chip class helpers; parity with Python pinned by hand-computed percentile tests
- `src/lib/strategies.ts` — the seven `StrategyDef`s (tabs, icons, sort keys) pinned to `tests/fixtures/strategies.json`; regenerate the fixture with `pipenv run python scripts/gen_strategy_definitions.py` after changing the Python specs
- `src/lib/costBasisBand.ts` + `src/lib/holdingsOverlay.ts` — the two quarterly overlays on the price chart, both built on `src/lib/quarterlyOverlay.ts::mergeQuarterly` (step-fill a quarterly series onto price points; nothing before the first quarter on record)
- `src/lib/routes.ts` — single source of truth for route paths (`ROUTES` + `stockPath`/`fundPath`/… builders)
- `src/lib/aiClient.ts` — SSE calls to `/api/ai/*`
- `src/components/ModelSelector.tsx` — reads `models.csv` via `getModels()`; `CLIENT_TO_PROVIDER_ID` maps CSV `Client` column to provider IDs
- `src/components/TerminalOutput.tsx` — macOS-style streaming terminal
- `src/pages/` — Landing (home `/`), Dashboard (Latest Filings, `/latest`), QuarterlyTrends, StrategyPerformance (`/performance`), RegimeSignals (`/regime`), Learn (FAQ, `/learn`), FundPortfolio, StockBrowser, StockAnalysis, AIRanking, AIDueDiligence, FundsConfig, AISettings, DatabasePage
- `src/components/EquityCurveChart.tsx` + `src/lib/equityCurve.ts` — multi-series cumulative-return curve for the `/performance` page (one line per strategy + benchmark, toggled via pills). `buildChartData` + `seriesColor` are the pure transforms (kept out of the component file for fast-refresh); the long CSV is parsed into per-series records by `parsePerformanceRows` in `dataService.ts`.
- `src/pages/Learn.tsx` (FAQ) + `src/lib/faqContent.ts` (content as plain data) + `src/lib/seo.ts` (React-free helpers: `canonicalUrl`, `buildFaqJsonLd`/`buildBreadcrumbJsonLd`, `renderFaqStaticHtml`) + `src/hooks/usePageMeta.ts` (per-route title/description/canonical/OG + JSON-LD for the live SPA, no `react-helmet`). The canonical origin is the single constant `SITE_ORIGIN`/`SITE_BASE` in `seo.ts` — switching to a custom domain is one edit (keep `SITE_BASE` in sync with `BASE_PATH`).

### Database (CSV files)

All in `database/`:

- **`hedge_funds.csv`** — curated tracked funds. Columns: CIK, name, manager, **Denomination** (exact legal name for non-quarterly matching — see Footguns), additional CIKs (comma-separated; used ONLY for non-quarterly filings by design, never for 13F fetches), URL.
- **`models.csv`** — available AI models (id, description, provider). Editable at runtime.
- **`stocks.csv`** — CUSIP → Ticker → Company. Auto-sorted on exit.
- **`non_quarterly.csv`** — recent 13D/G + Form 4 activity.
- **`{YEAR}Q{N}/`** — per-fund 13F per quarter (one CSV per fund).
- **`sector_hierarchy.csv`** — Yahoo Finance sector → industry mapping, derived empirically from `stocks.csv` after the classification backfill. The Sector for any stock is derived at read time by joining this file on the Industry column.
- **`regime.csv`** — regime signals in **long format**: one row per (`kind`, `quarter`, `key`, `value`), where kind is `metric` (position churn, capital recycling, untouched share, turnover), `mega` (basket weight + chain-linked split-adjusted share index) or `sector` (weights as % of classified value). Regenerated by `pipenv run gen-regime`; bundled to GH Pages and read by the `/regime` page.
- **`performance.csv`** — multi-strategy backtest in **long format**: one row per (series, consolidated window), where a series is a strategy or a benchmark (`series_type`/`series_id`). Carries per-window + cumulative return, plus (strategies) stock count, excess vs SPY, turnover. Regenerated by `pipenv run gen-strategy` / updater option 11; bundled to GH Pages and read by the `/performance` page.

## Frontend: Global Search & Company Logos

- **`app/frontend/src/components/GlobalSearch.tsx`** — top-bar search across tickers, companies, fund names and managers. Substring scoring with prefix priority, grouped dropdown, keyboard nav (`⌘K`). Builds its index from `getStocks()` + `getHedgeFunds()` (no extra fetch).
- **`app/frontend/src/components/CompanyLogo.tsx`** + **`companyLogoUrl.ts`** — renders logos via Cloudinary fetch URL pointing at Financial Modeling Prep's public symbol endpoint. The `cloud_name` is hardcoded in `config.ts` (it's public by design). Logos are cached at the CDN edge after first fetch; `scripts/warm_cloudinary_cache.py` pre-warms the full DB.
- **Cloudinary security**: Strict transformations ON, with `dokson.github.io` whitelisted in *Allowed strict referral domains*. *Allowed fetch domains* restricted to `images.financialmodelingprep.com`. Source pivoting and arbitrary new transformations are blocked.
- **`excluded_hedge_funds.csv`** — funds intentionally not tracked, with CIKs (re-add by moving rows back to `hedge_funds.csv`).

## Data updates / GH Actions automation

Three workflows touch the repo:

**`.github/workflows/filings-fetch.yml`** — 4× daily Mon–Fri (01:30, 13:30, 17:30, 21:30 UTC) + Saturday 04:00 UTC. Fetches new filings, commits to **`automated/filings-fetch` branch** (NOT master). Opens GitHub Issues for unidentified filers. To merge: review the branch's diff, then merge into master.

**`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`** — Triggers on push to `master` when `app/frontend/**` or `database/**` change. Builds `--mode gh-pages`, deploys via `actions/deploy-pages@v4`. Requires Settings > Pages > Source = "GitHub Actions".

**`.github/workflows/python-tests.yml`** — Full test suite on push/PR.

**`.github/workflows/lint.yml`** — Ruff + format check + mypy + oxlint + Prettier check + tsc on push/PR. Blocks merging if dirty.

## Branch hygiene

- **Solo maintainer pushes directly to `master`** — CI (lint + tests) still runs on every push. **External contributors must open a PR**; see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full flow.
- **`automated/filings-fetch` is bot-owned.** Don't commit hand changes there; they get overwritten.
- **Feature branches**: short imperative name (`feat/portfolio-tracker`, `fix/sse-leak`).
- **Before pushing**: `pre-commit run --all-files` should pass clean.

## Conventions

### TDD is mandatory

Iron rule: **no production code without a failing test first**.

1. Write the failing test
2. Run it; verify it fails for the *expected* reason
3. Write minimal code to pass
4. Run all tests; nothing else broke
5. Refactor while green

**Red flags**:
- Code exists before a test exists → delete the code, start with TDD
- Test passes immediately → you're testing existing behavior, not new
- Can't explain the original failure → the test isn't proving anything

### Done checklist

Before marking a task complete:

- [ ] Failing test written first (watched it fail for the right reason)
- [ ] All tests green: `pipenv run python -m unittest discover` + `cd app/frontend && npm test`
- [ ] Type-check clean: `pipenv run pyright` (config in `pyrightconfig.json`)
- [ ] Lint clean: `pipenv run lint && cd app/frontend && npm run lint && npm run type-check`
- [ ] Format clean: `pipenv run format` and `cd app/frontend && npm run format`
- [ ] Edge cases covered, no rationalizations ("I'll test after" / "I already manually tested")

### Docstrings

Every Python function and method has a docstring. Triple-double-quote, description on its own line:

```python
def my_function():
    """
    Description of what this function does.
    """
```

Not inline `"""description"""`. No exceptions.

### Inline comments

Default to no inline comments — clear naming should carry the WHAT. Only add one when the WHY is non-obvious: a hidden constraint, a subtle invariant, a workaround for a specific bug, behavior that would surprise a reader. Never restate what the next line already says, never leave stale/obvious `# TODO`s, and never reference the current task, PR, or issue number (that belongs in the commit message, not the code). Keep the ones you do write to a single short line — no comment blocks.

### Language

All code, comments, docstrings, commit messages, and user-facing strings: **English only**.

### Code patterns

- **AI clients**: subclass `AIClient` (`app/ai/clients/base_client.py`). Same interface, different APIs.
- **Retries**: `tenacity` library, exponential backoff. Used in scrapers and AI clients.
- **Validation loop**: `AnalystAgent` retries AI responses up to 7× via `promise_score_validator.py`.
- **Caches**: `__llmcache__/` (AI responses), `__reports__/` (generated reports). Both gitignored.
- **Lazy imports in handlers**: `app/server.py` route handlers `import` their service deps *inside the function body*, not at module top. This is deliberate — it keeps server startup fast (heavy modules like `yfinance`/`AnalystAgent` load on first use) and avoids import cycles between the server and the analysis/AI layers. Keep new handlers consistent; put business logic in a service module (e.g. `app/stocks/ticker_changes.py`) and have the handler lazy-import and delegate.

### Data consistency

- `stocks.csv` auto-sorted on DB exit (avoids git noise; see Footguns)
- `non_quarterly.csv` refreshed by GH Action and by manual `pipenv run update`
- `hedge_funds.csv` updates auto-sync the README's excluded-funds section

## Data freshness limits

- **13F**: filed within 45 days of quarter-end → 45+ days old when public
- **13D/G**: filed within ~10 days of trigger event
- **Form 4**: filed within ~2 business days

The tool merges non-quarterly into quarterly views to compensate for 13F lag, but understand the inherent gaps:
- Only US long equity (no shorts, derivatives, non-US)
- Non-quarterly matching depends on `Denomination` accuracy
- Data is incomplete by design

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` → `.env`. All keys optional:

| Var | What it enables |
|---|---|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub Models provider (free tier) — recommended minimum |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Google Gemini |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Groq (free) |
| `HF_TOKEN` | HuggingFace Inference API |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | OpenRouter aggregator |
| `OPENFIGI_API_KEY` | OpenFIGI CUSIP→ticker resolution (raises rate limit from 25 to 250 req/min) |
| `FMP_API_KEY` | Financial Modeling Prep ticker→CUSIP reverse lookup for Form 4 (free tier 250 req/day). Without it, new Form 4 tickers get a GitHub issue and the CUSIP stays null until the next 13F cycle. |
| `BARS_CACHE_DIR` | Local daily-OHLCV cache (`bars.parquet` + `splits.parquet`) read first by the cost-basis band; without it every ticker falls back to yfinance. |

App degrades gracefully when keys are missing — providers without keys are simply skipped in the model picker.

## Hedge fund curation

`hedge_funds.csv` is a **curated** list selected via custom methodology emphasizing cumulative returns while penalizing volatility (Sharpe-like) and drawdowns (Sterling-like, with dampened recovery penalty). Actively maintained — underperformers removed, strong performers added.

Specialists (healthcare/biotech) and mega-funds (Berkshire, Citadel, Bridgewater) are intentionally excluded — analysis quality drops when tracking very large/diverse portfolios. See `excluded_hedge_funds.csv` for the full list with CIKs (re-add by moving rows back).
