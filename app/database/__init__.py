"""
CSV-backed data-access layer, split into cohesive submodules:

- ``quarters`` — quarter discovery + 13F/fund-data loaders
- ``stocks``   — stocks.csv CRUD, the stocks lock, and ticker-change cascades
- ``funds``    — hedge-fund add/delete/restore and their CSVs

This package module is the canonical namespace: it owns the shared constants
(``DB_FOLDER`` and the ``*_FILE`` names), the path-safety helpers, and the
in-process lock primitive, then re-exports every public function so existing
imports (``from app.database import X``) keep working unchanged.

``DB_FOLDER`` lives here on purpose — tests monkeypatch
``app.database.DB_FOLDER`` to redirect I/O at a temp dir, so submodules
must read it as ``_db.DB_FOLDER`` (call-time attribute access) rather than
binding a local copy.
