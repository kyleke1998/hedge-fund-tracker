/**
 * Pure data module: the canonical list of CSV files that the GH Pages static
 * build copies from /database/ into /dist/database/. Imported by both
 * copy-database.mjs (the actual script) and copy-database.test.ts (regression
 * guard that asserts the list stays in sync with dataService.ts fetches).
 *
 * Kept side-effect free so the test can import it without running the build.
