class FinanceLibrary(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for financial data libraries.

    Defines a standard contract for classes that resolve CUSIPs to tickers and fetch
    company / price information from different financial data sources.

    `get_ticker` and `get_company` are required (every library must implement them).
    Price-related methods are optional — subclasses override the ones they support;
    the base no-op default returns None so PriceFetcher can iterate over libraries
    without runtime hasattr checks.

    # requested date. Long weekends and holiday closures need a few days of
    # slack, but an unbounded reach silently resolves a delisted or halted
    # ticker to its last-ever quote — which the backtest would then book as a
    # real exit price and record a fabricated flat return.
